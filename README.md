# Equation Quizz
## Overview 
Welcome to the **Equation Quiz** manual where it is designed to help the user understand how to use the program, Equation Quiz and does not require any programming experience. 
## User Manual
The purpose of this quiz-like program is to generate simple random mathematical equations for the user to solve and essentially test one's knowledge. These equations can come in any of the following formats whereby the symbol "?" or question mark is what the user is trying to solve as shown below;

- 3 + ? = 12
- ? - 3 = 12
- 3 * 4 = ?
  
In the equation will consist of two randomly generated factors i.e. the operands (two numbers) and the operation. Operations can be either; Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication or Division. The third and final part of the equation is the missing part or 'question mark' which is the number the user will be solving as mentioned in the above. 

### Main Features
1. User choice for number of equations
One of the features of this program is that it will prompt the user how many equations they would like to solve and than ask them that many times.
2. Timed Answer
Equation Quiz is able to time the user's session measuring how long it takes for them to complete the quiz. The timer will start when the actual quiz part of the program starts (excluding any prior activities) and will stop as soon as the user completes the quiz. 
3. User Streak
The user streak is another unique feature designed to display the current streak of the user i.e. how many questions in the quiz they have got correct. 
4. Score tracker

#### Requirements
- A computer or laptop running any of these operating systems; Windows, macOS or Linux
- Python version 3.6 or higher installed on your computer
- Access to a terminal or command prompt


#### How to Run Program
1. Python version 3.7 or later installed locally
2. Download the python file from the repository accessed via this link: https://github.com/sameerahmahmood/if1-sum1-task1/blob/main/random_equation_generator.py

An example screenshot is shown below.

## Technical Documentation
### Overview
This part of the guide demonstrates the technical side of the program, Equation Quize including the Design, Coding Standards as well as being able to clone a reponsitory from collaboration platform such as GitHub. 

### Cloning a Repository
Prior to running the program, it is important to know how to create a copy of the repository that stores the program file on one's computer which allows the for using, editing and updating changes back the repository in real time as well as version control. 

1. Get the Repository URL
   
The repository page of this specific program is located on the popular software developer collab platform called GitHub. Simply locate the repository of choice and copy the URL from the search bar.

2. Terminal

Then search for a terminal for example Command Prompt or Windows Powershell and Bash if you are working with Linux.

4. Directory Navigation

Use the 'cd' command navigate to a folder where you would like to clone the repository i.e. where you store the copied repository as shown below. 

```cd <desired_folder>```

5. Using the git clone Command

```git clone <repository_url>```

6. Cloned Repository Navigation

In order to change the current directory into the cloned repository directory, simply use the 'cd' command again but with cloned repository name instead like this:

```cd name_of_repository```
